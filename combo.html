<h1>Basic Attacks</h1>
<h3>Every blade has a unqiue special and set of arts, specials have different affects like cause more damage, heal, or topple</h3>
<h3>The game will auto attack when you aren't move, or using specials/arts</h3>
<h3>Attacking will fill up a meter on the top left corner of the screen which when a bar is charged, you can revive down teamates by pressing A</h3>
<h3>Arts are basically the power moves that inflict more damage than specials do and are charged up using set specials</h3>
<h3>These arts also have elements which are used for primarly in blade combos</h3>
<h1>Blade Combos</h1>
<h2>There are multiple stages for every combo</h2>

        <td>Combos start whenever you or a party memeber uses any of your arts</td>
        <td>Activates at art level 1</td>

        <tr>
        <td>Level 2</td>
        <td>Any of the elements that combine with the element use, which is displayed right next to the art in use, will activate level 3</td>

        <tr>
        <td>Level 3</td>
        <td>The final art that has to be used, any of the elements listed to the end of the combo chart will cause this attack</td>
        <td>Activates at art level 3</td>
    </tr>

<h3>To help you find which attack to you next, a white border will be created around the element in the combo (from the picture it's stage 2 combo)</h3>
<h3>Doing these combos, having a full bars on that meter from before, and pressing + on your controller will cause a chain attack</h3>
<h3>This will cause you use arts again, but with more damage you'll notice an element symbol on the top screen</h3>
<h3>Breaking it will cause a burst allowing you to go around a second time and doing even more damage, you can repeat the process as many burst you get</h3>
<h3>Matching elements with their weakness cause the elements to break faster</h3>
<h3>Once an attack is caused another meter will come up on the top and you have to do your next attack before it depletes</h3>
<h3>Getting 4 burst will cause a final burst that causes you to an even stronger attack</h3>
